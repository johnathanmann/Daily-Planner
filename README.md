## Summary
This site helps you plan out your day and keep track of events that will happen or have happened. This site works by checking the current hour using moment.js and comparing it to the hours on the planner to decide weather or not times of the dau have happened. The text inputs are only saved to local storage if the save button is clicked. The save button is curtesy of Font Awesome. The clear data button works by clearing localStorage and refreshing the page. During the creation of this project an emphasis was put on implementing JQuery when it seemed fit.
